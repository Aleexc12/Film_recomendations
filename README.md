# Film Recommendations

This project aims to provide personalized film recommendations based on voice commands. By leveraging speech-to-text transcription, the application processes user commands and queries a film database to suggest movies that match the user's preferences.

## Features

- **Voice Activation**: Detects a wake word to start listening for user commands.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts audio input into text using Whisper AI.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Interprets user commands to extract preferences such as genre or duration.
- **Film Database Query**: Uses external APIs to fetch film data and recommendations.
- **Customizable Responses**: Delivers movie suggestions through a user-friendly interface or voice output.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your API keys for any external services (e.g., TMDB).
4. Run the application and enjoy personalized movie recommendations!

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with more APIs**: Expand support to other film databases.
- **Offline Functionality**: Enable recommendations without internet connectivity.
- **Improved NLP**: Enhance command interpretation for more complex queries.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
